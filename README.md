In order to pass XML and XDS utilizing schema and DTD, i created a Java parsing class.
 A "DomParserSchema" class was built along with an XML document. Created a code after reading Dr. Lixin Tao's second chapter.
 and made two distinct files with the names "shops.xml" and "shops.xds." I obtained the required output after debugging the code. In The previous step I made a file called "shops.xml" and another file called "DomParserDTD."
In this case, I just prepared an XML file in accordance with the specifications, which helped me to get the desired result.
